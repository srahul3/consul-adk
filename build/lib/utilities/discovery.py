# utilities/discovery.py
# =============================================================================
# 🎯 Purpose:
# A shared utility module for discovering Agent-to-Agent (A2A) servers.
# It reads a registry of agent base URLs (from a JSON file) and fetches
# each agent's metadata (AgentCard) from the standard discovery endpoint.
# This allows any client or agent to dynamically learn about available agents.
# =============================================================================
